# Rajeshwara Reddy Sanikommu - Portfolio

This repository contains the source for my personal portfolio website. The layout is inspired by the [developerFolio](https://github.com/saadpasta/developerFolio) template and includes a hero banner with a typed text animation, sections for skills and experience, recent GitHub projects and a separate resume page.

## Development
The site consists of static HTML, CSS and a small JavaScript file that fetches my public repositories from GitHub and powers the typed animation. Clone the repository and open `index.html` directly in your browser for local testing.

## Deployment
The site is ready for GitHub Pages. To deploy:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub and push these files.
2. On GitHub, go to **Settings** > **Pages** and select the `main` branch as the source.
3. Save the settings and your site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>`.

Feel free to customize the colors, GIFs and content in `style.css` and `index.html` to make the site your own.
