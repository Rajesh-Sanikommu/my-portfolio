# Rajeshwara Reddy Sanikommu - Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio website. It draws design inspiration from the [developerFolio](https://github.com/saadpasta/developerFolio) project and features:

- A hero banner with Typed.js animation
- Sections for about, skills, experience, education, projects and contact
- Recent repositories loaded dynamically from GitHub
- A separate resume page styled to match the site

## Development

The site is completely static. Clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser to test locally. Customize the accent color or hero GIF in `style.css`.

## Deployment

To deploy on GitHub Pages:
1. Push the files to a GitHub repository.
2. On GitHub, open **Settings** â†’ **Pages** and choose the `main` branch.
3. Save the settings and GitHub will host the site at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>`.
